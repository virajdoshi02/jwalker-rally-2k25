<h3 align="center">A rally-inspired game where you are a spectator</h3>

**Concept:**

We were hosting [UPGRADE](https://pennupgrade.com/)'s 2024 Halloween game jam, and we decided to also participate for fun. Since we also had to complete other work, we decided to make a simple physics based game and finally settled on this concept. We ended up with something very simple but also funny and enjoyable, an endless procedural game that you can play for hours without getting bored.

**My Team:**

I created this game with Anthony Ge and Charles Wang.

<br>

**My Roles in the process:**

* Design:

  * Fine tuned values for player experience

* Development:

	* Player movement
  
	* Car Physics

  * Death effects
  
<br>

**Challenges:**

* Time constraint:

	* We only had 24h to develop and build the game, and we also started late and had to manage food and logistics for the entire jam

* Tuning car physics:

	* The cars would either go in wide arcs or turn sharply at every point, which was unsatisfying, so I had to find a way to slow them down just enough to make the game more fun

  * I also had to make the car hone in on the player very slightly to increase the difficulty and make things more fun
